Well, this one calculates complementary color by definition.
If you want to play with the brightness, IMHO, the easiest way is to convert to HSV (hue-saturation-value) model,
also called HSB (hue-saturation-brightness), like here (https://planetcalc.com/5788/) and play with the B parameter.

Hold your horses, I believe it's not so easy,
if you check for example a color like FF7F6B you'll notice that as the color gets brighter then the complementary starts getting darker,
which in theory is fine but if you check many online converters you'll notice that the complementary actually doesn't get darker because
what I believe that they do is to also flip the brightness.

So also notice how the sum of both colors will always be FFFFFF (never grays as stated in the description),
with the other method I believe you can get more balanced colors and their sums can be for example 7F7F7F, 000000 and all the possible combinations of grays.
