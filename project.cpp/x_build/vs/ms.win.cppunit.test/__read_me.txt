::ToDo: it is necessary to call one unit test project from other and at the same time to keep minimal dependencies from the libraries
        that are being tested or other libraries that are referenced from those which are tested;
        for example, loading test images of named/custom themes is required for different unit test projects and this functionality should be shared;
