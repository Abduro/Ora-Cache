taking into account that all project related files are created manually (files of all projects, filters and properties in this solution),
there is some trick preventing to start a work with new project files in VS code explorer properly:
	!!! do not forget !!!! to specify required property page file name in project file, otherwise there is a lot of time will be spent for nothing;

*VS*BUGS*

#1 Steps:
1) After manually adding a file to the project, the file is displayed in the Solution Explorer;
2) Clicking on the file to open it in the code editor of the VS;
3) VS displayes the error box 'FileStream will not open Win32 devices such as disk partitions and tape drivers. Avoid use of "\\.\" in the path';
4) Close the error box and right click on the file node for displaying the context menu;
5) Choose 'Properties' menu command;
!) Crash of the VS in couple of seconds; (VS2017 Community Edition)
*) The reason is the code file name contains 'con' as part of the file name, like this: 'con.font.h' ; after renaming to 'console.font.h' VS works as expected;

*important*
in case when a reference path to external project is changed, reloading the project, for which the reference is changed, does not help to use that path in the code;
because VS does not read new path or does not take it into account;

unloading a solution and VS itself does not help too;
the only step to fix it is:
	deleting the folder .vs;

SLN file manual edition:
(1) it is impossible to separate GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution section to separate sections,
    due to the last one is only taken into account by MS Build; postSolution & preSolution section value does not affect this behaviour;
(2) Removing reference highlight:
    Tools >> Options >> Text Editor >> C/C++ >> Advanced >> References >> Disable Reference Highlighting = True ;
