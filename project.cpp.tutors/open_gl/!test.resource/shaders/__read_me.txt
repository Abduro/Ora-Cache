Common Shading Languages
Different graphics APIs use different shading languages, which typically have a syntax similar to the C programming language and are optimized for vector and matrix operations.

/* alias | full name                         | file ext. | brief description ;
---------+-----------------------------------+-----------+------------------*/
  GLSL   | OpenGL Shading Language           |  *.glsl   | the most widely known and used shading language for displaying 2D and 3D content;
  HLSL   | High-Level Shading Language       |  *.hlsl   | the primary shading language for Microsoft's Direct3D API;
  MSL    | Metal Shading Language            |  *.msl    | Apple's proprietary shading language designed for the Metal graphics API;
  WGSL   | WebGPU Shading Language           |  *.wsl    | the newer language designed for the WebGPU API as a portable and safe alternative for modern web graphics;
  AGSL   | Android Graphics Shading Language |  *.agsl   | is used on Android 13 and above, sharing much of its syntax with GLSL fragment shaders;
